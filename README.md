# MacroPad
A collection of pcb and other files used in the creation of BedoDev's MacroPad.

# DISCLAIMER:
The libraries used for schematics and footprints are forked from other open source keyboard projects.
After I figure out how to use submodules i will remove them from the repo and create links to the original submodules from their respective git projects.
